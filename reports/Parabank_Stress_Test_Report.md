# Stress Testing Report for ParaBank Website

## 1. Introduction

**Test Objective:** Assess the performance and stability of the ParaBank website under high stress conditions, simulating large-scale concurrent user activity.

**Test Type:** Stress Testing

**Test Scope:** The test simulated a gradual increase in the number of virtual users, reaching a maximum of 5,000 users.

**User Distribution:**
- **Start with 1,000 users**: Gradually ramped up over 300 seconds, each with a randomized delay between 1 and 1.5 seconds per request.
- **Increment of 500 users every 60 seconds**, with start points for each new user distributed over 150 seconds, until reaching 5,000 users.

**Testing Tool:** Apache JMeter

### Users Completing Full Scenario:
- **Users with no failures:** 814 users
- **Average Execution Time for Completed Users:** 32.57 seconds


## 4. Observations

- The system showed **acceptable performance** under moderate load, but **response times increased noticeably** under higher loads, with:
  - **Average Response Time:** 2661.89 ms  
  - **Maximum Response Time:** 33,100 ms  

- **Significant failure rates** were observed in several request types:
  - `create account`: ~54â€“55% success rate
  - `register`: 64.02% success rate
  - `deposit`, `transfer`, `billpay`: success rates in the ~73% range

- The overall **success rate** across all requests was **82.23%**, indicating **potential performance and reliability issues** under heavy load.

- **Common errors encountered:**
| ***Error***                          | ***Description**              | ***Count*** |
|-----------------------------------|:------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| HTTP 400                          | Bad Request                  | 6,543     |
| HTTP 500                          | Internal Server Error        | 3,697     |
| SocketTimeoutException            | Timeout Exception            | 128       |
| HTTP 404                          | Not Found                    | 619       |
| NoHttpResponseException           | No Response from Server      | 5         |

- Despite the above issues, some request types maintained **high reliability**, including:
  - `logout-0`: 100% success
  - `Get JSESSIONID`: 99.09% success
  - `account balance`: 95.36% success

## 6. Recommendations

1. **Investigate critical failure points**, particularly in the `register`, `create account`, and `billpay` requests, which showed success rates below 75%. These endpoints are crucial and need reliability improvements under load.

2. **Analyze error distribution and causes**, especially the high counts of HTTP 400, 500, and timeout-related errors. These indicate potential issues with input validation, server resource handling, or backend availability.

3. **Improve error handling and resilience**, ensuring users who encounter partial failures can recover gracefully or retry automatically where appropriate.

4. **Optimize server performance**, particularly for operations with high average response times such as `logout` (4499 ms), `login` (2449 ms), and `register` (2684 ms). Backend/database performance tuning may be required.

5. **Conduct further stress tests at higher user loads** (beyond 5,000 users), with longer durations, to uncover scalability thresholds and long-term stability.

6. **Monitor system capacity and scale dynamically**, especially during peak loads, using load balancers, database connection pooling, and horizontal scaling techniques.

7. **Ensure test data consistency and isolation**, particularly for operations like `create account` or `transfer`, where dependencies between data may cause conflicts or unexpected behavior during concurrent access.


## 7. Conclusion

The ParaBank system showed moderate resilience under stress, successfully handling over 61,000 requests with an overall success rate of **82.23%**. While core operations such as login, balance inquiries, and logout maintained high success rates, several critical functionalitiesâ€”particularly `register`, `create account`, `deposit`, and `billpay`â€”suffered from substantial failure rates ranging between **25% to 45%**.

These issues indicate that while the system can manage concurrent users up to 5,000, it does experience performance degradation and functional instability under peak loads in specific workflows. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to improve the overall reliability, user experience, and scalability of the application under real-world high-traffic scenarios.

Continued optimization and targeted testing of the most error-prone features are highly recommended as next steps.
